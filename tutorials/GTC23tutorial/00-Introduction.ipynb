    "**Session-based recommendation (SBR)** has been an important task in online services like e-commerce and news portals, where users may have very distinct interests in different sessions. SBR models have been proposed to model the sequence of interactions within the current user session. They have gained popularity due to their ability to capture short-term or contextual user preferences towards items, and to provide promising model accuracy results. \n",

    "Merlin is an open-source framework for building large-scale (deep learning) recommender systems. It is designed to support recommender systems end-to-end from ETL to training to deployment on CPU or GPU. Common deep learning frameworks are integrated such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Its key benefits are the easy-to-use APIs, accelerations with GPU and scaling to multi-GPU or multi-node systems."

Therefore, we use [Booking.com dataset](https://github.com/bookingcom/ml-dataset-mdt) to train a session-based model. The raw train dataset contains 1,166,835 of anonymized hotel reservations given 217,686 unique trip ids made across 39,000 destinations. Each reservation is a part of a customer's trip (identified by utrip_id) which includes consecutive reservations. For more details, please refer to [Booking.com Multi-Destination Trips Dataset](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3404835.3463240) published as a resource paper at SIGIR'21.\n",
