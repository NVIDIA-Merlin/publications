    "Recommender Systems (RecSys) are the engine of the modern internet and the catalyst for human decisions. Building a recommendation system is challenging because it requires multiple stages (data preprocessing, offline training, item retrieval, filtering, ranking, ordering, etc.) to work together seamlessly and efficiently. The biggest challenges for new practitioners are the lack of understanding around what RecSys look like in the real world, and the gap between examples of simple models and a production-ready end-to-end recommender systems.\n",

    "Industrial recommender systems have major tasks to accomplish that can be quite demanding. One requirement is to deliver a recommendation under the expected latency requirements (e.g., within milliseconds) to warrant a good user experience. That might require a significant amount of creativity and engineering. And the second consideration is that we might want to minimize infrastructure costs while solving the latency issue, which is yet another obstacle to overcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "In large scale recommender systems pipelines, the size of the item catalog (number of unique items) might be in the order of millions or billions. At such scale, a typical setup is having two-stage pipeline, where a faster candidate retrieval model quickly extracts thousands of relevant items and a then a more powerful ranking model (i.e. with more features and more powerful architecture) ranks the top-k items that are going to be displayed to the user. Therefore, industrial recommender systems usually consists of candidate retrieval and ranking (scoring) stages. The candidate retrieval stage retrieves candidate items that are relevant to user interests, while the ranking stage sorts candidate items by user interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we start with the first stage of multi-stage recommender systems- the Candidate Retrieval. For ML-based candidate retrieval model, as it needs to quickly score millions of items for a given user, a popular choices are models that can produce recommendation scores by just computing the dot product the user embeddings and item embeddings. Popular choices of such models are `Matrix Factorization (MF)`, which learns low-rank user and item embeddings, and the `Two-Tower architecture`, which is a neural network with two MLP towers where both user and item features are fed to generate user and item embeddings in the output. Such models can be efficiently served by indexing the trained item embeddings into an Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) engine and during inference scoring user embeddings over all indexed item embeddings within the engine.

In Merlin Models we provide some scalable negative sampling algorithms for the Item Retrieval Task.
